``institute-tools`` -- A Publication System for Cyborg Institute
================================================================

``institute-tools`` is a port and evolution of `mongodb/docs-tools
<https://github.com/mongodb/docs-tools>`_ for the `Cyborg Institute
<http://cyborginstitute.org>`_. Fundamentally, ``institute-tools``
exists to ease the maintenance burden for collections of related sites
and projects by centralizing common tools and infrastructure.

``institute-tools`` is a collection of packages that integrate with
existing Python tools like `Fabric <http://docs.fabfile.org/>`_ and
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, and integrates with a project
using a lightweight bootstrapping script.

In some ways, ``institute-tools`` replaces ``sphinx-quickstart`` and
make, to provide a sane method to use Sphinx and host Sphinx sites
without services like `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. *Read
the Docs* is great, of course, but self-hosting is easy and provides
additional flexibility and control.
